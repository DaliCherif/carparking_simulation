 Smart Parking System with ESP32 + Firebase + React Native
A real-time smart parking solution where:

ESP32 reads button inputs (representing parking spots).

The state of each button (occupied or empty) is sent to Firebase Realtime Database.

A React Native mobile app displays live parking spot status, updating in real-time using Firebase.

A servo motor is optionally controlled via Firebase to simulate a gate or barrier
